# Deltares-Climate-Change

Okay so here is a quick Git tutorial in case you are using the command line:

    git status For checking (locally) what files have changed

    git add . For adding things (in this case everything because of the ".") to the staging area (locally)

    git commit For commiting (i.e. writing into the database) everything that has been added to the staging area

    git push For uploading the committed stuff to the server
